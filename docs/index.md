# Artifactory Pipeline Provider

The [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) Pipeline provider is used to interact with Artifactory Pipelines. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Links to documentation for specific resources can be found in the table of contents to the left.

This provider requires access to Artifactory APIs, which are only available in the _licensed_ pro and enterprise editions. You can determine which license you have by accessing the following URL `${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/`

You can either access it via api, or web browser - it does require admin level credentials, but it's one of the few APIs that will work without a license (side node: you can also install your license here with a `POST`)

```bash
curl -sL ${host}/projects/api/system/licenses/ | jq .
{
  "type" : "Enterprise Plus Trial",
  "validThrough" : "Jan 29, 2022",
  "licensedTo" : "JFrog Ltd"
}
```

The following 3 license types (`jq .type`) do **NOT** support APIs:
- Community Edition for C/C++
- JCR Edition
- OSS

## Authentication

The Artifactory Pipeline provider supports one type of authentication using Bearer token.

### Bearer Token

Artifactory access tokens may be used via the Authorization header by providing the `access_token` field to the provider block. Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `PIPELINE_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Pipeline provider
provider "pipeline" {
  url          = "projects.site.com"
  access_token = "abc...xy"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) This is a Bearer token that can be given to you by your admin under `Identity and Access`. This can also be sourced from the `PIPELINES_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable. Defauult to empty string if not set.
- `check_license` (Boolean) Toggle for pre-flight checking of Artifactory Enterprise license. Default to `true`.
- `url` (String) URL of Artifactory. This can also be sourced from the `PIPELINES_URL` or `JFROG_URL` environment variable. Default to 'http://localhost:8082' if not set.
